# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

### The purpose of this Election audit analysis was to see which county and which candidate received the most votes. We wanted to see what the difference was among all three counties and which county had the highest turnout. We also wanted to know what the percentage of votes was for each county.

## Election-Audit Summary
### This script can be used for any election or data pulling. If someone has a database where one needs to get specific numbers, this script can be used. It can be modified for finding the number of losses if there are any. One can change the script to finding the dates of when the votes were cast and times also, if available in the data sheet. You can also try to find the candidate with the least amount of votes and the county that had the smallest turnout. There are many things one can find with the script.
